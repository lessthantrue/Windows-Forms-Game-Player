Things necessary for Farseer Physics bridge to WinForms GamePlayer

/	Implemented
x	Never Implemented
-	Not Started
*	In progress

Framework
	/ Basic Scenes? (Can be applied to just GamePlayer instead. might do that)
		/ Scenes static class, Example: Game.ActiveScene = Scenes.Menu;
	/ A collection of different implementations of Game gathered together that can be switched

Drawing
	/ capability to draw physics bodies
		/ Default options
		/ Capability for custom drawing
			/ Transformed and not transformed?
	x Not drawing what is outside of view
	/ Scale

World (Reference SpaceIO for this)
	/ Physics world incorporated with GameControl (scene?)
		/ Ticking properly
	/ Different scale because max units/s is 2 for some god forsaken reason.

Bodies
	/ Both particle(?) and physics body implementation
	/ Easy way to add bodies into a scene/world
